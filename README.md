# StudentsMinimalApi
I created an example minimal API that exposes endpoints that you can use to access or change data related to an example Student class using the HTTP protocol.

I also tried to predict common problems that may occur when a client calls my API and return the most appropriate status codes for the particular case.

Problem Details is used for providing machine-readable errors for HTTP APIs.
